Scheme Experiment
=================

Inspired by the infamous
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][1]
, lovingly called [SICP][2], I wanted to try my hands on a little bit
of scheme.

I will roll my own [regular expression][4] library.

MIT-Scheme
----------

I will be using [mit-scheme][3] as my scheme interpreter.

Run Test
--------

We are using the [test-manager][5] to manage are tests. Run the code below to 
execute all the tests.

    scheme --load test/all-tests.scm
