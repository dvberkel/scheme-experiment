Scheme Experiment
=================

Inspired by the infamous
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][1]
, lovingly called [SICP][2], I wanted to try my hands on a little bit
of scheme.

I will roll my own [regular expression][4] library.

MIT-Scheme
----------

I will be using [mit-scheme][3] as my scheme interpreter.
